# Top-50-Songs
Viper implementation on retrieving 50 top songs with public API

App retrieves 50 items from "https://rss.applemarketingtools.com/api/v2/us/music/most-played/50/albums.json" and shows them on a TableView Controller
To achieve this VIPER architecture is used.
Every step of VIPER works.

Problems need to be fixed:

1 Cache response once it arrives
2 Search Bar optimisation (after 1 this will be fixed automatically)
3 SecondViewController UI imrovements
4 Refresh func needs to retrieve images
